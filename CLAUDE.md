## Project overview

The personal site, rebuilt light. Next.js App Router. The home page is a
single vertically centered column on white. MDX blog posts live under
`app/blogs/`, interactive experiments under `app/lab/`.

This project replaces the previous dark version of the same site. It is
intended to be force-pushed over `github.com/SanyamPunia/www`.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm dev          # next dev --turbopack
pnpm build        # next build --turbopack
pnpm lint         # biome check
pnpm format       # biome format --write
pnpm tc           # tsc --noEmit
pnpm check        # all three, this is the gate
```

`pnpm check` must be green before any push.

## Color tokens

Defined once in `app/globals.css` under `@theme`. **No raw hex and no palette
utilities in components.** If a colour is needed that has no token, add the
token here first.

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `bg` | `#ffffff` | page background |
| `surface` | `#fafafa` | raised panels |
| `fill` | `#f4f4f5` | pill background, resting |
| `fill-hover` | `#ebebec` | pill and list-row hover |
| `fill-active` | `#e0e0e2` | pressed state, one step past hover |
| `stroke-soft` | `#f2f2f2` | dividers in long lists, where `stroke` reads as a table |
| `stroke` | `#ebebeb` | hairline rules, borders |
| `stroke-strong` | `#dcdcdc` | scrollbar thumb, emphasised edges |
| `text-primary` | `#1a1a1a` | lead copy, headings |
| `text-secondary` | `#6b6b6b` | body copy |
| `text-muted` | `#9b9b9b` | metadata, footer |
| `accent` | `#3b82f6` | **logo mark only**, never text or links |
| `danger` | `#b84a41` | invalid input, see below |
| `selection` | `#34d399` | text selection highlight, see below |
| `inverse-bg` | `#0a0a0a` | dark ground, see below |
| `inverse-fill` | `#111111` | raised tile on a dark ground |
| `inverse-stroke` | `#1e1e1e` | hairline on a dark ground |
| `inverse-text` | `#fafafa` | lead copy on a dark ground |
| `inverse-text-secondary` | `#8f8f8f` | supporting copy on a dark ground |

**`selection` is user-driven, not decoration.** Nothing renders in it until
someone drags across text, which is why a saturated hue over a whole run of
prose does not reopen "no accent colour on text or links". It pairs with
`text-primary` at 9.05:1, so selected prose reads as well as unselected.

Only the selected text constrains this tone. The carets did too while they
straddled the highlight, but they sit wholly outside it now, so it is free to
move. The floor is around `#0b9160`, where dark text drops to 4.34 and the
selected text would have to go light.

**Carets at the ends of a selection are a component, not CSS.** `::selection`
accepts `color`, `background-color`, `text-decoration`, `text-shadow` and the
text-fill properties, and nothing else: no `content`, no pseudo-elements of its
own. `components/ui/selection-pins.tsx` measures the live `Range` instead and
draws two hairlines, mounted once in the root layout since selecting text is a
whole-document behaviour. Their height comes from the line rect they terminate,
so they match whatever type they sit in, and each carries a `size-1.25` knob
centred on both tips. `size-1` would be 3.2px on this scale, and a fractional box
cannot resolve a clean circle, so one of the two renders squared off.

They sit **outside** the highlight, not straddling it, and that is what lets them
be `stroke-strong`, the same token the `InlineLink` underline uses at rest. A
straddling caret has to survive both the white page and the highlight, which no
light grey does: over the emerald, `text-muted` is 1.26 and `text-secondary`
1.52, so the inner half simply disappears.

**`danger` is the one status tone.** Hue carries meaning here rather than
decoration, the same exception the brand marks and the syntax colours get, so
it does not reopen "no accent colour on text or links". It is 4.91:1 on
`surface` and is the lightest red that still clears 4.5:1 at the 14.4px
semibold it is used at. `#c2544b` was the first pick and fails at 4.31. There
is deliberately no success or warning tone, add one only when a surface needs
it, with the contrast checked the same way.

**The `inverse-*` set is not dark mode.** Nothing switches to it and there is
still no `dark:` variant anywhere. It is a surface a component opts into when a
light ground genuinely cannot work, which so far means exactly one case: an
asset that is white on transparent. `components/labs/spring-image/` renders
`/assets/logo.webp`, the site's own mark in white, which on `bg` painted as an
empty ring. Recolouring the mark was not an option, so the ground inverted.

The values are the previous dark build's, so the two versions of the site stay
recognisably related. `inverse-text` is 18.97:1 on `inverse-bg` and
`inverse-text-secondary` is 6.12:1. Check any new pairing: `#6f6f6f` was the
first choice for the secondary tone and fails at 3.94.

Reach for this only when the alternative is invisible content. A surface that
is merely *nicer* dark is not a reason, that is the dark build this project
deliberately replaced.

## Local overrides

- **No dark mode.** One light theme. The shared "every surface works in light
  and dark" rule does not apply, there is nothing to switch to. This replaces
  the previous version's inverse override (it was dark-only).
- **No accent colour on text or links.** Hierarchy comes from tone and weight
  alone. This is deliberate and is most of why the design reads clean.
- **Nothing scales on press. There is no `active:scale-[0.98]` in this
  codebase.** The shared rule mandates it on every tappable element and this
  project overrides it outright. At this scale a 2% transform shifts an edge by
  a fraction of a pixel, under the threshold for reading as motion and over the
  threshold for changing antialiasing, so fine detail smears sideways rather
  than shrinking. GitHub, X, Bitscale and SoundCloud all showed it plainly.
  Layer promotion (`transform-gpu`) and whole-pixel box dimensions were both
  tried and neither helps, because an inline target sits wherever text layout
  puts it and the transform is sub-pixel by definition.

  Press is a background step instead: `hover:bg-fill` then
  `active:bg-fill-hover` on unfilled targets, `active:bg-fill-active` where the
  resting state is already filled. Do not reintroduce the scale.
- **All lowercase**, via `text-transform` on `body` in `app/globals.css`, not by
  writing the copy in lowercase. The markup keeps real casing, so crawlers,
  screen readers and copied text still get "Oliv AI". Write new copy in
  sentence case and let the stylesheet do it. `code`, `pre`, `kbd` and `samp`
  are exempt, lowercasing code would corrupt it.

  **Form controls need `text-transform: inherit` spelled out.** They do not
  inherit it on their own, and Tailwind's preflight `font: inherit` does not
  cover it, since text-transform is not part of the font shorthand. Without
  that rule any label inside a `<button>` keeps its source casing while the
  prose around it lowercases.

## Scale

The design sits at 0.8 of a conventional scale. **That factor is baked into the
tokens, so every value in `@theme` is the size it actually paints.** There is
no root override, `html` stays at the browser default.

`--spacing: 0.2rem` is the important one. Tailwind derives every `gap-*`,
`p-*`, `h-*` and `size-*` from it as `calc(var(--spacing) * n)`, so that single
token rescales all of them and no call site carries a scale factor. The radius
tokens and the type scale are set the same way.

Two rules follow:

- **Never reintroduce a global root font-size.** It would multiply on top of
  these tokens, and it silently catches anything added later, including
  third-party UI that was never designed against this scale.
- **Resize the page by changing `--spacing` and the type tokens together**, not
  by adjusting individual utilities at call sites.

Values in `px` sit outside the scale and stay fixed. That is correct for
hairlines and focus rings, and it is why new sizes should be `rem` or `em`.

## Type scale

`text-lead` 16.8px/1.5 opening paragraph, primary tone.
`text-body` 14.4px/1.6 supporting paragraphs, secondary tone.
`text-action` 12.8px/1.5 weight 500, buttons and inline links.
`text-meta` 12px/1.6 muted tone, footers, tooltips and quiet notes.

No ad-hoc `text-[15px]`, and no Tailwind default sizes either. `text-xs` and
friends are not on this scale, so they render out of proportion with everything
around them. Add a scale token if a genuinely new size is needed.

**`cn()` has to be told this scale exists, and `lib/utils.ts` tells it.**
tailwind-merge classifies `text-*` by reading the value: a t-shirt size is a
font size and anything else is a colour. These roles are named rather than
sized, so `text-meta` was landing in the colour group beside
`text-text-primary` and losing, and `cn("text-meta", "text-text-primary")`
returned the colour alone. No error, no warning, the element just inherited
whatever size sat above it.

It only bites when a role and a tone meet inside one `cn()` call, which is why
it survived: rare enough to read as a design decision rather than a dropped
class. It had silently unsized both `DropdownMenu` rows, and it is what made
the post rail render larger than the prose it indexes. `extendTailwindMerge`
declares the group once and fixes every call site, which is the only scale at
which this is fixable, since the failure is invisible at each one.

**A new role here needs a matching entry in `TYPE_SCALE` in `lib/utils.ts`.**

**Every home page paragraph is `text-body`.** Only tone separates them, primary
for the opening one and secondary for the two below it. Matching them at
`text-lead` instead was tried first and looked worse, the larger supporting
paragraph read as a wall. Do not "fix" any of them back to `text-lead`, and do
not drop the closing note to `text-meta`, it was deliberately raised to match
the paragraph above it.

`text-meta` serves the footer, tooltips, section labels and row metadata.

**`text-lead` is the page title, and only that.** `/work`, `/blogs` and every
post open with a real `<h1>` at `text-lead`, followed by a `text-body`
`text-secondary` line, grouped at `gap-2` so the two read as one block. No
weight change, nothing on this site is bold, the step is size and tone.

**On an index the lead line is secondary, never primary.** The list is the
content and that line is context. At primary it is the same size and the same
tone as every row title and the page reads as one flat list.

The home page is the exception and keeps its `sr-only` h1: its opening
paragraph genuinely is the content, not a description of content.

## Icons

Phosphor supplies every UI icon. Social brand marks come from
[svgl.app](https://svgl.app) and live in `components/icons/`, one file per mark,
with the source route named in a comment. svgl has no Medium, so that single
mark stays on Phosphor's `MediumLogoIcon`.

**Brand marks keep their real brand hex.** This is the one sanctioned exception
to the semantic-tokens-only rule: a brand colour is not a theme colour, it
belongs to the company, and tinting it makes it a different logo. The hex lives
in the mark's own component and nowhere else. Do not add these to `@theme`, and
do not reach for them in any other context.

Because the fill is fixed, a mark does not answer to `currentColor`, so the
footer's hover on a social link is the background step alone. `MediumLogoIcon`
is the exception and still tints, since Phosphor draws in `currentColor`.

Marks set `aria-hidden="true"` and `focusable="false"` before the prop spread,
since the anchor wrapping them carries the label and Biome's
`a11y/noSvgWithoutTitle` fires otherwise.

- **Import the `*Icon`-suffixed exports only.** `CheckIcon`, not `Check`. The
  bare names are deprecated in 2.1 and will be removed.
- **Server components import from `@phosphor-icons/react/dist/ssr`.** The main
  barrel pulls in `createContext` and throws in RSC. Only a `"use client"` file
  may import from `@phosphor-icons/react` directly.
- Sizing is `size-*`, never the `size` prop, so the Tailwind scale stays the one
  source of truth. Inline-in-text icons use `size-[0.9em]` so they track the
  copy they sit in.
- Weight stays at the `regular` default. Do not pass `weight` per call site.

## Inline links

`InlineLink` is the one treatment for a link in prose, and it renders in two
shapes off a single rule: **a link whose host has a mark becomes a pill, a link
without one stays underlined text.** Call sites pass nothing extra, the shape
is derived from the href.

- The pill is the same `rounded-full bg-fill` shape as the primary button, sized
  entirely in `em` so it tracks the text it sits in. Never give it a fixed
  height or a per-call-site size.
- **`leading-none` on the pill is load-bearing. Do not remove it.** An
  inline-flex takes the prose line-height for its own text item, so without it
  the pill is the whole line box plus its padding: 27.36px inside a 23.04px
  line, overlapping the lines above and below by 4.32px. It is not a style
  choice, it is what keeps the pill inside its own line.

  The trap is that raising the paragraph's leading looks like the fix and is
  not. It grows the pill by exactly the same amount, so the overlap never
  moves. That was tried first and did nothing. `py-[0.25em]` then spends the
  reclaimed height back, so the pill paints the size it always did.
- **Prose leading is looser below `sm`**, set on `--text-body--line-height` in
  `app/globals.css`. A narrow column wraps often enough that nearly every line
  carries a pill, so 1.44px between them reads as touching, and 1.85 takes it to
  5.04px. A wide column almost never stacks two, and keeps the tighter 1.6.
- Marks live in `public/assets/favicons`, registered by host in
  `lib/favicons.ts` with their intrinsic width and height. They are downloaded,
  never hotlinked and never fetched from Google's favicon service, so a page
  load makes no third-party request.
- The registry carries dimensions because not every mark is square. A wide one
  set to the square height runs twice as long and swamps the line, so wide
  marks get a smaller height to match the others' visual mass.
- Adding a link to a new host means adding its mark to the registry, otherwise
  it silently renders as a plain underlined link.

## Layout

Every page renders inside `PageShell` (`components/ui/page-shell.tsx`), which
owns the `min-h-svh` centering and the column width. `align="center"` for the
home page, `align="top"` for the longer index pages. Never set a per-page
`max-w-*`, change `CONTENT_WIDTH` instead.

## Work page

`app/work/page.tsx` is a server component. `components/work/` holds the client
pieces, `lib/work.ts` the data.

- **Rows, never cards.** A company and a project render through one `WorkRow`
  shape, flattened in `lib/work.ts` so the page stays layout only. Nothing on
  this site is a card, the old build's bordered container did not come across.
- **No disclosure, no client state.** Each row links straight out, so
  `WorkList` is a server component and no row data crosses to the browser. An
  in-place accordion with the open row in `?open=` was built and then removed
  as unnecessary.
- **`lib/work.ts` carries only what `WorkRow` reads.** It used to keep
  `details`, `preview`, `description`, `collaborators` and a job `title` warm
  for that removed detail view. Nothing read them, and the `preview` paths had
  gone stale on top of that: every one pointed at an image no longer in
  `public/`. If a detail view returns it gets content written for it, not fields
  kept on the chance. `Company`, `Project`, `companies` and `projects` are not
  exported either, `workSections` is the module's whole surface.
- **A leader rule, not dividers.** Each row is logo, name, a hairline that
  absorbs all the slack, then the date. Fifteen dividers on top of that read as
  a table.
- **Row logos keep their brand colour**, in one shared `rounded-full` tile with
  a `ring-stroke` hairline. The source logos are six different silhouettes,
  some carrying their own square ground and some bare, so an unframed row never
  settles. `overflow-hidden` on the tile is what unifies them: a logo with its
  own background gets clipped into the circle, a bare mark sits inside it
  against `bg-fill`. Greyscale-at-rest was tried and rejected.

## Page transitions

A crossfade between routes, via React's `<ViewTransition>`.

- `components/ui/page-transition.tsx` wraps **each page's content**, not the
  root layout's children. A layout's children slot keeps its position in the
  tree across a navigation, so React reconciles it as an update rather than an
  unmount and a mount, and `enter`/`exit` never fire.
- **It is propless on purpose.** A bare `<ViewTransition>` uses the browser
  default, which is a crossfade, so there are no keyframes to maintain and
  nothing depends on `::view-transition-old(.class)` selectors, which need
  Chrome 125+ and diverge in Safari. Only the duration is tuned, against
  `root`, in `app/globals.css`.
- Directional slides keyed off a Link's `transitionTypes` were built and then
  removed. They are a bigger effect than these pages need and they cost that
  class-selector dependency. Re-adding means a types map on the boundary,
  `transitionTypes` on the links, and keyframes per direction.
- **No config flag. Do not add one back.** This needed
  `experimental.viewTransition` in `next.config.ts` up to Next 16.2, and 16.3
  dropped the key: view transitions work in the App Router with nothing set, and
  passing it now fails the typecheck with "'viewTransition' does not exist in
  type 'ExperimentalConfig'". See
  `node_modules/next/dist/docs/01-app/02-guides/view-transitions.md`.
- **The App Router's `react` is Next's own bundled copy, which is the copy
  exporting `ViewTransition`.** The installed `react@19.2.8` does not export it,
  so `require("react").ViewTransition` is `undefined` in Node and that is
  expected. It is a bundler alias rather than a package resolution.
- `@types/react` declares it in `canary.d.ts`, opted into by
  `types/react-canary.d.ts`. A triple-slash reference rather than a
  `compilerOptions.types` array, which would switch off automatic `@types`
  discovery for everything else.

## Blogs

`app/blogs/page.tsx` is the index. A post is a directory under it holding three
files:

- `meta.json`, `{ title, description, date, readTime }`. **`date` is ISO
  `YYYY-MM-DD`**, formatted for display by `formatBlogDate`. The old site
  stored display strings like "mar 19, 2023" and sorted them lexically, which
  put March before November and gave crawlers nothing machine-readable.
- `page.mdx`, **pure content, no layout**. The old site put the page shell
  inside every post's MDX, so each carried its own copy and they drifted.
- `page.tsx`, the route. It exports `metadata` from the json and renders
  `<BlogPost meta={meta}><Content /></BlogPost>`.

`page.mdx` is not a route on its own, `pageExtensions` excludes md and mdx.

- `mdx-components.tsx` is the one place prose is styled. Everything there sits
  on the project's type scale and tone tokens, never a Tailwind default size.
  `strong` renders as a tone step, not bold, since nothing on this site is
  bold. List bullets are `before:` dots for the same reason as elsewhere: a
  flex parent blockifies its children and kills a real marker.
- Content headings start at **h2**. The shell renders the h1, so an h1 in the
  body would be a second one.
- Code fences render through `components/ui/code-block.tsx`. `sugar-high`
  emits `sh__*` classes coloured by the `--sh-*` properties in `globals.css`,
  which are **greys, not a syntax rainbow**, so a code block stays inside the
  page's monochrome.
- A missing `meta.json` hides a directory from the index, so a draft can sit
  in the tree unpublished.
- A post's demo component is **colocated** in the post directory when only that
  post uses it, and lives in `components/blogs/` when it might not be. Its
  import goes at the top of `page.mdx`.

### The post rail

`components/blogs/post-rail.tsx` is the left margin above `lg`: the back link,
then the post's own sections with the one being read marked by a bar that
travels between rows rather than a border toggling on each.

- **The back link lives here, not above the title.** Both are chrome about the
  page rather than content in it, and stacking them put a control between the
  reader and the first line. `BlogPost` keeps a second copy in the column
  wrapped in `lg:hidden`, so exactly one is on screen at any width. The rail
  renders even when a post has no sections, because the back link does not
  depend on them.
- **It reads the rendered headings, not the MDX source.** `rehype-slug` writes
  the ids (declared as a string in `next.config.ts`, since Turbopack passes
  plugins to Rust and cannot take a JS function), and the rail queries those
  exact elements out of the `article`. Parsing the source instead would mean
  reimplementing the same slug algorithm and hoping the two never diverge, and
  a divergence there is a dead anchor rather than a build error. The cost is
  that the rail arrives on mount: it is `fixed`, so nothing moves when it does,
  and it fades in on the standard variant rather than appearing.
- **A heading only carries an id if its component passes one through.**
  `Section` and `Subsection` in `mdx-components.tsx` spread their props for
  that reason. Dropping the spread silently empties the rail.
- **A row is a list of tokens, not a string.** Several headings name a file or
  an identifier in a `code` span, and flattening `configure _app.tsx` to text
  loses the one thing that says which half is a filename. The rail indexes the
  headings, so it has to read like them. The code token sets no tone of its
  own, so it follows the row between muted and primary.
- **It is fixed in the margin, never a flex sibling.** As a sibling it takes its
  width out of the row and pushes the column off centre, so a post would stop
  lining up with every other page. It positions off `CONTENT_HALF_REM`, which
  has to move whenever `CONTENT_WIDTH` does. 14rem of clearance for a 12rem
  rail leaves a 2rem gutter, and at exactly `lg` its left edge lands on the
  page's own `px-6`. Any wider and it runs off screen at that width.
- **`pb-1` on the rail is not spacing, it is what keeps a scrollbar away.**
  `BackLink` draws its underline as an `after:` pseudo-element at `-0.1em`,
  which paints below the anchor's box, so on a post with no sections the
  content was one pixel taller than the container. `overflow-y-auto` does not
  care that it is one pixel: it painted a 6px thumb down the right-hand edge
  beside a single link with nothing to scroll.
- **The reading line sweeps in the last screenful, and that is load-bearing.**
  `MorePosts` sits below the article and is shorter than a viewport, so the
  page bottoms out before the final headings can climb to a fixed line. Three
  of the four posts with headings never get their last one above 80px and one
  never gets its last two, which left rows that could never mark themselves.
  The usual patch, snapping to the last entry at the bottom, does not fix it,
  it skips whatever sat between. Do not replace the sweep with a constant.
- Fewer than two headings renders no list. One entry is not a table of
  contents, it is a heading already on screen.
- There is no mobile equivalent. Below `lg` a post has no structural
  navigation, which is the same trade the design makes everywhere else.

### Section anchors

`components/blogs/heading-anchor.tsx` puts a hash on every heading the rail
lists, hidden until that heading is hovered. It is how a reader gets the URL
for one section instead of the whole post.

- **A real `<a href="#id">`, never a button.** That is what updates the address
  bar, scrolls, and lands the heading under its own `scroll-mt` natively, and
  it is what lets the link be opened in a new tab through the browser's own
  menu. The clipboard write is added on top rather than replacing any of it.
- **The confirmation is the icon swapping to a tick, and the anchor is held
  visible while it does.** That second half is what makes it work. The control
  scrolls the heading it sits on, so the pointer is left behind and the hover
  ends in the same frame the tick appears. Tied to `group-hover` alone it swaps
  and hides simultaneously, which is indistinguishable from no feedback. The
  copied state is the only thing allowed to override the hover.
- **The tooltip label never changes.** Radix closes a tooltip on click, so a
  "copied" label there can never be seen. It stays "Copy link to section" and
  the `aria-label` carries the copied state instead. A toast was tried and
  removed: three copies stack three toasts, and the tick is right where the
  reader is already looking.
- The crossfade is `CodeBlock`'s, so both copy controls on a post behave the
  same way. It is not a true path morph. Nothing here can compile one, and
  `torph` animates text rather than geometry.
- The anchor holds its box whether or not it is visible, so revealing it never
  shifts the leader rule beside it. It sits before that rule, since a control
  past the rule's end reads as belonging to the next thing down.
- `BlogPost` mounts one `TooltipProvider` around the article, rather than one
  per heading.

## Lab

`app/lab/page.tsx` is the index, `app/lab/[slug]/page.tsx` the detail. Each
experiment is a directory under `components/labs/`.

- **The page is a server component; the dynamic import map is not.**
  `next/dynamic` rejects `ssr: false` inside a server component, and the
  experiments are all browser-only, so the map lives in
  `components/lab/experiment.tsx` behind `"use client"`. The page keeps its
  metadata, static params and `notFound`.
- **`IMPLEMENTED_LABS` in `lib/labs.ts` gates the routes** and the map is typed
  against it, so listing a slug without adding its component is a build error
  rather than an empty frame. An entry in the registry with no component 404s.
- `file-tree-explorer` is the one slug whose directory is named differently
  (`file-tree`), carried over from the old repo.
- **No preview images.** The old registry pointed at screenshots of the dark
  build, wrong on a white page and wrong about what the components look like
  now. The detail page runs the real component.
- Four experiments still carry a local `styles.css`. That is the one place the
  one-stylesheet rule bends, they are self-contained demos whose CSS is not
  part of the design system. Their colours still come from tokens via
  `var(--color-*)`. `cursor-origin-button` had one and it was folded into
  Tailwind, including its asymmetric enter/leave timing, so prefer that when
  touching the others.

## Motion

**Every page opens on the same stagger.** `Reveal` wraps the page column and
each top-level block is a `RevealItem`. `Reveal` passes children straight
through, so anything inside it stays a server component, which is why
`WorkSection` still renders on the server despite sitting inside one. Blocks
sit at `gap-12`.

`MotionProvider` in the root layout sets `reducedMotion="user"` globally, so
Motion skips transform and layout animation for anyone with the OS setting on.
Do not add a blanket CSS `!important` reduced-motion reset, it is redundant and
fights the library.

Standard variants, reused rather than reinvented:

```ts
// fade + blur + rise
initial={{ opacity: 0, y: 4, filter: "blur(6px)" }}
animate={{ opacity: 1, y: 0, filter: "blur(0px)" }}
transition={{ duration: 0.4, ease: "easeOut" }}

// staggered children
variants={{ hidden: {}, show: { transition: { staggerChildren: 0.08, delayChildren: 0.35 } } }}
```

## The signature

`public/assets/signature.svg` is the mark at the left of the footer, drawn on
rather than faded in. `components/home/signature.tsx` fetches and injects it
once it is in view, and the `.signature` rules in `app/globals.css` own the
reveal.

- **The asset is a pen path, not a font conversion.** It used to be six glyph
  outlines from the source font, one per letter, each a closed contour running
  around the stroke and back. Stroking those and animating `stroke-dashoffset`
  started every letter wherever its own contour began, so the mark assembled
  itself from six places at once. The file now holds two centreline strokes in
  writing order: the top of the `s` through the `y`'s tail, then the last `a`
  and `m` after the one pen lift the mark has.
- **The strokes were derived from the outlines, not redrawn.** The outlines were
  rasterised, thinned to a skeleton, split at the crossings, and walked as an
  Eulerian trail with a straightest-continuation rule at each one. An arc whose
  ink is wider than a single stroke is two strokes merged into one ribbon, which
  is the `n` tips and the `m` entry, so the trail runs out and back along it.
  Nothing in the repo reproduces that, so treat the two paths as source.
- **`stroke-width` is 4.4, which is not the pen's real width.** The old runtime
  stroked the outlines at 2.5, and stroking an outline paints the fill dilated
  by half that on each side, so the mark on screen was about 2.4 times bolder
  than the font draws it. 4.4 on the centreline reproduces that at 93% pixel
  overlap, checked in a browser at 32px and at 96px. The designed weight is
  nearer 2.2, which is a deliberate change rather than a fix if it is made.
- **The viewBox is baked in, and the asset carries its own paint attributes.**
  The component used to strip every fill, set stroke, width and caps per path,
  measure each path with `getTotalLength()`, and retighten the viewBox from
  `getBBox()` because the source box was a 375 square with the ink low inside
  it. All of that is in the file now, so the component measures nothing.
- **`pathLength="1"` is what keeps the stylesheet in plain numbers.** Without it
  every dash length would have to be measured in JS first.
- **The dash pattern is `1 2` resting at 1.02.** A pattern of `1` repeats every
  two path lengths, so at offset 1 a dash begins exactly on the end of the path,
  and a zero-length dash under `stroke-linecap: round` paints as a dot: a blob
  sitting past the end of the mark while a stroke waits its turn. The gap of 2
  puts that repeat out of reach, and the 0.02 keeps the pattern's other boundary
  off the start of the path, since engines differ on whether a dash that ends at
  zero length paints there.
- **The two durations are one write split by length.** 1.1s and 0.4s are the
  paths' 73/27 share of a 1.5s total, so both move at the same pen speed and the
  second starts where the first stops. Durations that are not proportional read
  as two different hands.
- **Reduced motion is handled in the stylesheet.** These are raw keyframes, so
  `MotionProvider`'s `reducedMotion` does not govern them, the same as
  `disc-spin`.

## Toolchain notes

- **TypeScript 7.** The compiler is the native port, which dropped the JS
  compiler API Next reads by default. `experimental.useTypeScriptCli` in
  `next.config.ts` routes Next's typecheck through the `tsc` CLI instead.
  Removing that flag breaks `next dev` with an unhandled rejection.
- **Biome 2.5.** `css.parser.tailwindDirectives` must stay on or Biome fails to
  parse `@theme` in `app/globals.css`.

## Spotify now-playing

`lib/spotify.ts` is the provider, `app/api/now-playing/` the route the client
polls, `components/home/now-playing.tsx` the album cover stacked behind the
avatar at the top of the home page.

Environment, all server-only except the last:

| Variable | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` | yes | from the Spotify developer dashboard |
| `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET` | yes | same |
| `SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN` | yes | minted once, see below |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` | only to mint | the origin the OAuth redirect returns to |

- **Missing credentials are not an error.** `lib/spotify.ts` checks for them and
  reports nothing playing, so the site boots with the cover absent. The old
  version threw from a helper and relied on an outer catch, which meant a typo
  in a variable name looked identical to Spotify being down.
- **The route sends `Cache-Control: no-store`, and `force-dynamic` is not enough
  on its own.** That flag governs prerendering, not the CDN, so a response with
  an `s-maxage` window still gets cached at the edge in production and every
  visitor in a region shares one poll. The client's `cache: "no-store"` only
  covers the browser, so the header has to say it too. There are three fetches
  in this feature and all three are `no-store`: the token exchange, the
  currently-playing call, and the route's own response. Do not reintroduce a
  cache window here, a stale now-playing line is the one thing the feature
  cannot survive.
- **Minting the refresh token is a one-off manual flow.** Set the first two
  variables plus `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000`, add
  `http://localhost:3000/api/spotify/callback` to the app's redirect allow-list
  in the dashboard, visit `/api/spotify/login`, approve, and the callback
  returns the token as JSON to paste into `SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN`. Spotify
  matches the redirect URI byte for byte, which is the whole reason
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL` exists rather than the flow reading `SITE_URL`.
  Neither auth route is linked from anywhere and neither stores anything.
- **It renders inside `Avatar`, not as its own block.** It was a "p.s. currently
  listening to X" paragraph in the column first, and that could not work: a block
  arriving on a network response cannot join the opening stagger, so it either
  interrupted the sequence or turned up after it, and it needed a timed cue to
  look deliberate either way. Living inside a `RevealItem` that already animates
  means no cue and no extra child. Do not put it back in the column.
- **The reveal is keyed off the tooltip's `data-state`, not only `:hover`.** The
  tooltip sits 8px to the right, so moving onto it leaves the anchor and `:hover`
  drops while Radix keeps the tooltip open, which slid the cover back under an
  open label. `hover:` stays alongside it, because `data-state` only flips after
  `delayDuration` and waiting 150ms to start moving reads as lag.
- **The cover's ring is not `ring-inset`.** Its `<img>` is `size-full` and paints
  over an inset ring, so there was no visible edge at all. This is the same trap
  as the number-counter and the dashed border: a child paints over a parent's
  inset ring.
- **The disc turns via `paused` / `running`, not by adding the animation on
  hover.** `disc-spin` is always attached and only its play state toggles, so
  leaving the pill holds the disc at whatever angle it reached. Gating the
  animation itself would restart it at `0deg` and snap on every unhover. It is
  `motion-safe:`, since `MotionProvider` does not govern raw CSS keyframes.
- **`disc-spin` is declared in `globals.css` rather than using
  `animate-[spin_…]`.** Tailwind only emits its own `spin` keyframes when
  `animate-spin` is used, so naming `spin` in an arbitrary value can compile to
  an animation with nothing to run.
- `pickCover` takes the 300px art, not the 64px one. 64 is closest to the 40px
  disc by pixel count and the wrong choice, since it is already soft at 2x.
- The mark in the tooltip is `components/icons/spotify.tsx`. `Tooltip`'s `label`
  takes a `ReactNode` for that, and its content is a flex row so a mark and text
  align without the call site rebuilding the box.

## Structured data

`lib/schema.ts` builds the JSON-LD, `components/ui/json-ld.tsx` renders it. Every
route emits exactly one block: `Person` + `WebSite` in a `@graph` on the home
page, `ProfilePage` on `/work`, `CollectionPage` with an `ItemList` on the two
indexes, `BlogPosting` per post, `SoftwareSourceCode` per experiment.

- **Everything is derived, never restated.** Titles, dates and lists come from
  `meta.json`, `labsRegistry` and `getAllBlogs`, the same data the page renders.
  The shared rules ban marking up what a page does not visibly show, and a
  hand-copied title is how that happens by accident.
- **`dateModified` is deliberately absent.** Nothing records when a post was
  last edited, so stamping `datePublished` there would assert "never edited
  since" as fact.
- **The email is deliberately absent.** It is already public on the page, but
  machine-readable markup hands it to scrapers for no ranking benefit.
- The renderer escapes `<` as a unicode escape. A `</script>` inside any string value
  would otherwise close the tag early, and `JSON.stringify` does not do this.

## Internal linking

`MorePosts` and `MoreLabs` sit at the foot of every post and experiment.

Before them each of those pages was a leaf with exactly one inbound link, its own
index, and nothing linked between them, so there was no cluster for a crawler to
follow. They are titled "More posts" / "More experiments", not "Related":
there is no tag or topic data to compute relatedness from, so a heading
promising it would be a claim the ordering cannot support. `MoreLabs` filters on
`isImplemented`, or it would point every lab page at a 404.

## SEO routes

`robots.ts`, `sitemap.ts` and `not-found.tsx`, all reading `SITE_URL`.

- **`sitemap.ts` lists only routes that resolve.** Lab pages are gated on
  `IMPLEMENTED_LABS`, so a registry entry without a component 404s and must not
  be advertised. Every entry is implemented today, which is exactly why the
  filter belongs in the code rather than in someone's memory.
- **No invented timestamps.** The old sitemap stamped `new Date()` on the four
  static routes, so every crawl saw them claim they had changed that second.
  `lastModified` is omitted where nothing real backs it, and `/blogs` and
  `/lab` borrow the newest date from the content they list.
- **`robots.ts` allows `/` rather than enumerating routes.** The old version
  listed every blog and lab path into `allow`, which `allow: "/"` already
  covers and which went stale on every new post. `/api/` is the one real
  exclusion, because `/api/spotify/login` redirects to Spotify's authorize
  screen.
- **`not-found.tsx` sets `robots: { index: false }`.** An indexed 404 competes
  with the real pages for the same terms. It centres rather than aligning top,
  since there is no content to scroll, and it carries no `BackLink` because the
  copy already names every route worth reaching.

## Directories

- `app/` routes. `components/ui/` shared primitives, `components/home/` and
  `components/work/` are per-surface, `components/icons/` holds brand marks.
  `components/home/avatar.tsx` is the first block on the home page: the photo,
  with the now-playing cover stacked behind it.
  A per-surface component moves to `components/ui/` the moment a second
  surface needs it, which is how `reveal.tsx` got there.
- `app/api/` route handlers. Only Spotify lives here, see below. Everything
  under it is `Disallow`ed in `robots.ts`.
- `lib/` no React. `constants.ts` layout tokens, `site.ts` copy and URLs,
  `work.ts` work data, `favicons.ts` the host-to-mark registry,
  `spotify.ts` the now-playing provider, `schema.ts` the JSON-LD builders,
  `utils.ts`.
- `types/` ambient declarations only. Currently just the React canary
  reference. Anything untyped from npm gets its `.d.ts` here.

## Keeping this current

Any new top-level directory gets documented here before the task is done. Any
new colour token gets a row in the token table. Any new type-scale entry gets a
line in the type scale section.
