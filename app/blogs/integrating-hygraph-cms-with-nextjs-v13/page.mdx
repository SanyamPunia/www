## Setting up hygraph
The first thing is to create our hygraph account. Go to their <a className="underline underline-offset-2 text-primary" target="_blank" href="https://hygraph.com/">website</a> and create one using any provider of your choice. Once you complete the process, select Add project & create your new project. Give your project a title and description & choose the region which is the nearest to your place.

## Creating a Schema Model
Now, head over to the *Schema* tab which is present on the left sidebar, and create a model.

Give a name to your model and then click Add Model. Now we need to add fields to our model. For Example, a blog might contain a *title*, *description*, *tags*, *cover image*, etc. So we can add the required fields to our model.

From the sidebar on right, select *Single line text*. Give it a name and select the required options as per your preferences. For example - Use as title field, Validations such as Make field required.

Add the fields of your choice and save the changes. This is what my field structure looks like. Yours might look different than this, just choose your preferences accordingly.

## Adding Content to the Schema Model
Let's now move on to adding custom data inside the fields we added to our data model. Click on the *Content* tab on the sidebar and then on *Add entry* in the top right corner of the website.
Fill in the fields accordingly. Your final content should look something similar

AND note, that the *slug* will be an auto-generated value extracted from the *title*. So it's advisable to set its attribute to *unique* in the schema model settings.
Now, after adding the desired content, click on Save & publish on the top left along with setting the cover image to the published stage as well (asked when you click Save & publish).

## API Playground
Heading over to the API playground (under the Assets tab on the right sidebar), here you can test your *GraphQL* queries to get the required data. Here is a sample query to get data from your content schema

```bash
query TestModels {
  testModels {
    createdAt
    description
    id
    publishDate
    publishedAt
    slug
    tags
    title
    updatedAt
  }
}
```

The query for getting particular data based on *slug*

```bash
query TestModels ($slug:String) {
  testModels (where:{slug: $slug}) {
    createdAt
    description
    id
    publishDate
    publishedAt
    slug
    tags
    title
    updatedAt
  }
}
```

You can set the Query Variables on the tab located at the bottom.

## Next.js Setup with hygraph & GraphQL
After playing with the API Playground, head over to your terminal and create a Next.js application & install the following dependencies

```bash
npm install graphql graphql-request
```

Now, instantiate a new GraphQL client in one of the routes

```js
import { GraphQLClient } from 'graphql-request';
const hygraph = new GraphQLClient(
  'hygraph-endpoint'
); 
```

You can get your *hygraph* endpoint by navigating to *Project settings* > *Endpoints* & copy the Content API. Now, send in your query request to hygraph using the client you just created, as follows

```js
import { gql } from 'graphql-request';
const QUERY = gql`
  {
    posts {
      id
      title
    }
  }`
const { posts } = await hygraph.request(QUERY)
```

We don't need to use any specific functions (like *getServerSideProps*, *getStaticProps*, etc) provided by Next.js in v13 as the whole route is rendered on the server side (unless you use the *use client* directive). Just use the *posts* in any components/routes depending upon your use case.

And that is how you integrate hygraph CMS + GraphQL with Next.js (v13).
