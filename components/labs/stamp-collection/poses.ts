 * is why the sequence reverses cleanly rather than needing a second set of poses
 * read backwards.
 *
 * `lead` is the stamp on top of that stack, and it is the selected one in both
 * directions: the one about to grow on the way in, the one that just shrank on
 * the way out. Without it the selection sat wherever its index put it, so a
 * middle stamp had to grow out from behind another one, and shrink back into
 * hiding.
 *
 * **The fan carries a lead too, and that is a whole beat on the way out.** A
 * stamp returning to the bottom of the row has to give up its `zIndex`, which is
 * discrete: stamp 0 went from in front of everything to behind everything in one
 * frame, while the other two were still piled on top of it, so nearly the whole
 * stamp vanished at once. So it travels to its own slot while still raised and
 * still on top, and only then tucks in. By then the row has spread and the
 * overlap it has to lose is one neighbour instead of two.
